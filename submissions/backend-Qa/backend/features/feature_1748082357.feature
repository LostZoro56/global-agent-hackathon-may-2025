Feature: User Account and Bookstore Interaction
As a user, I want to manage my account and interact with the bookstore's catalog and checkout process so that I can efficiently find and purchase books.

<think>
Alright, I need to create Gherkin scenarios for the online bookstore based on the provided user stories. The user wants 3-4 scenarios, each covering different aspects like happy paths, error cases, edge cases, etc.

First, I'll start with a happy path scenario. This should cover the core functionalities smoothly without any issues. I'll think about a user successfully searching for a book, adding it to the cart, checking out, and receiving an order confirmation. This covers search, add to cart, checkout, and order history in one flow.

Next, I'll handle an error case. A common error is when a user tries to add a book that's out of stock. I'll create a scenario where the user searches for a book, tries to add it, but gets an error message because it's out of stock. This tests error handling and data validation.

For an edge case, I'll consider a user trying to checkout without any items in the cart. This tests boundary conditions and ensures the system handles empty carts gracefully, prompting the user to add books before checking out.

I also need to ensure each scenario is properly tagged for different testing types, like functional or security. I'll use tags such as @functional, @security, and @edge_case to categorize them. Each scenario should have clear Given, When, Then steps with proper parameterization for test data and validation points.

I'll make sure the steps are atomic and focused, using consistent terminology. This makes the scenarios reusable and maintainable. I'll also include proper validation points, like checking the order confirmation page displays correct details or the error message appears as expected.

Finally, I'll structure each scenario with the correct Gherkin syntax, including the Scenario title and the steps without any markdown or extra explanations. This way, the scenarios are clean and ready for automation.

### Happy Path Scenario: Successful Book Purchase

gherkin

  @functional @security

  Scenario: Successful book purchase and order confirmation
    Given I am a registered user logged into the bookstore
    When I search for "The Great Gatsby"
    Then I should see "The Great Gatsby" in the search results
    When I click "Add to Cart" for "The Great Gatsby"
    Then I should see "The Great Gatsby" in my shopping cart
    When I click "Checkout"
    Then I should be redirected to the payment page
    When I enter valid payment details
    Then I should see an order confirmation page with the order details
    And I should receive an order confirmation email


    ### Error Case Scenario: Out-of-Stock Book

    gherkin

  @functional @error_handling

  Scenario: Attempting to purchase an out-of-stock book
    Given I am a registered user logged into the bookstore
    When I search for "Out of Stock Book"
    Then I should see "Out of Stock Book" in the search results
    When I click "Add to Cart" for "Out of Stock Book"
    Then I should see an error message: "This book is currently out of stock"
    And I should not see "Out of Stock Book" in my shopping cart


    ### Edge Case Scenario: Empty Cart Checkout

    gherkin

  @functional @edge_case

  Scenario: Attempting to checkout with an empty cart
    Given I am a registered user logged into the bookstore
    When I navigate to the shopping cart page
    Then I should see a message: "Your cart is empty"
    When I click "Checkout"
    Then I should see a message: "Please add items to your cart before checking out"
    And I should remain on the shopping cart page


    ### Security Testing Scenario: Invalid Login Attempt

    gherkin

  @security

  Scenario: Invalid login attempt with incorrect credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter an invalid username "invalid_user"
    And I enter an invalid password "wrong_password"
    And I click "Login"
    Then I should see an error message: "Invalid username or password"
    And I should remain on the login page

    <think>
    Okay, so I need to generate Gherkin scenarios based on the user's requirements for testing the boundaries of an online bookstore system. The user provided some examples like preventing invalid email formats during registration and handling maximum limits in the shopping cart. They also want scenarios for happy paths, error cases, and edge cases, all in proper Gherkin syntax without any markdown or extra explanations.

    First, I'll start with the happy path scenario. This is the ideal case where everything works as expected. For user registration, a happy path would involve a user entering valid credentials, especially a properly formatted email. So, the scenario would have Given steps where the user is on the registration page, When they fill in valid details, and Then they see a confirmation message.

    Next, the error case scenario. Here, I need to test what happens when the user enters an invalid email format. So, the Given is the user being on the registration page again, When they provide an invalid email, Then an error message should appear.

    For the edge case scenario, the example given was about adding the maximum number of books to the cart. I'll set this as 10 books. The Given is the user being on the search page, When they search for a book, add 10 copies, and Then the cart shows 10 books. This tests the system's handling of the maximum limit correctly.

    I need to make sure each scenario follows the Gherkin format, using Scenario: followed by the name, and then the Given, When, Then steps. Also, I should include appropriate tags like @registration and @cart to categorize the tests. Each step should be clear and automatable, focusing on the core functionality and boundary conditions as specified.

    I should also ensure that the scenarios are concise and only include the necessary steps without any additional explanations. The tags help in organizing the scenarios, making it easier to run specific tests later. By covering happy paths, error cases, and edge cases, these scenarios comprehensively test the system's boundaries and ensure robustness.

    I think that's all. Now, I'll format them correctly without any markdown or extra text, just the plain Gherkin scenarios as the user requested.
    </think>

    **Scenario 1: Happy Path - Successful User Registration with Valid Email Format**

  @registration @happy-path

  Scenario: Successful user registration with valid email format
    Given the user is on the registration page
    When the user enters a valid email format "test@example.com" and a valid password "Test1234"
    Then the user should see a registration confirmation message


    **Scenario 2: Error Case - Unsuccessful User Registration with Invalid Email Format**

  @registration @error-case

  Scenario: Unsuccessful user registration with invalid email format
    Given the user is on the registration page
    When the user enters an invalid email format "invalid-email" and a valid password "Test1234"
    Then the user should see an error message indicating the email format is invalid


    **Scenario 3: Edge Case - Adding Maximum Number of Books to Cart**

  @cart @edge-case

  Scenario: Adding the maximum number of books to the cart
    Given the user is on the search page
    When the user searches for a book and adds 10 copies to the cart
    Then the cart should display 10 books
    And the user should not be able to add more than 10 books

    <think>
    Okay, so the user has provided a set of user stories for an online bookstore and wants me to extract the key requirements. They also want me to include 3-4 Gherkin scenarios covering happy paths, error cases, and edge cases, all formatted correctly without any extra text or markdown.

    First, I'll go through each user story to identify the core functionalities.

    1. User Registration: This is about creating an account with email and password. So, the requirement is that users can register using their email and password.

    2. User Login: This involves logging in securely, so the requirement is about secure authentication for registered users.

    3. Search for Books: Users can search by title, author, or genre. So, the system needs a search feature that works across these criteria.

    4. Add Book to Cart: This is about enabling users to add items to their cart, so the requirement is the ability to add books to the shopping cart.

    5. Checkout: This involves a secure checkout process for payments, so the requirement is a secure checkout system.

    6. View Order History: Registered users can see their past orders, so the requirement is to display purchase history.

    7. Leave Book Review: Users can leave ratings and reviews for books they've bought, so the system needs a review and rating feature.

    Now, for the Gherkin scenarios, I need to cover happy paths, error cases, and edge cases.

    For the happy path, a successful login, search, add to cart, and checkout makes sense.

    An error case could be an invalid login attempt, which tests error handling for authentication.

    An edge case might involve a large number of search results, testing how the system handles that.

    I need to ensure each scenario follows the Gherkin format with Given, When, Then steps and appropriate tags. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the scenarios concise.

    I should also make sure the scenarios are atomic and cover different testing types as per the initial instructions, like functional and security testing.

    I think that's all. Now, I'll list the requirements and create the scenarios as per the user's request.
    </think>

    1. Users can register an account with their email and password.
    2. Registered users can log into their account using their credentials.
    3. Users can search for books by title, author, or genre.
    4. Users can add books to their shopping cart.
    5. Users can proceed to checkout and make a payment.
    6. Registered users can view their past orders.
    7. Users who purchased a book can leave a rating and review.

    ### Scenarios

    **@Functional**
    **Scenario:** Successful login and book search
    **Given** a registered user with valid credentials
    **When** the user logs in with their email and password
    **And** they search for a book by title "Programming Basics"
    **Then** the system should display the search results for "Programming Basics"

    ---

    **@Security**
    **Scenario:** Handling invalid login attempts
    **Given** a user attempts to log in with an invalid username
    **When** they enter "invalid_user" as the username and "wrong_password" as the password
    **Then** the system should display an error message "Invalid username or password"
    **And** the user should remain on the login page

    ---

    **@EdgeCase**
    **Scenario:** Handling a large number of search results
    **Given** the system has more than 1000 books in the database
    **When** a user searches for books by genre "Fiction"
    **Then** the system should display the first 50 results by default
    **And** provide pagination options to view more results

    ---

    **@Functional**
    **Scenario:** Adding a book to the cart and proceeding to checkout
    **Given** a user is logged into their account
    **When** they add a book titled "AI Handbook" to their cart
    **And** they proceed to checkout
    **Then** the system should display the book in the cart
    **And** allow the user to complete the payment process successfully

    <think>
    Okay, so I need to create Gherkin scenarios for an online bookstore based on the user's requirements. The user wants 3-4 scenarios covering happy paths, error cases, and edge cases. They also specified that each scenario should include @tags, a title, and the Given/When/Then steps without any extra explanations or markdown.

    First, I'll start with a happy path scenario where everything works smoothly. The user searches for a book, adds it to the cart, and checks out successfully. I'll make sure to include the necessary steps and a positive validation at the end.

    Next, I need an error case. A common error is when a book is out of stock. So, the scenario would involve a user adding a book to the cart, but upon checkout, they see an error message because the book is unavailable. This tests how the system handles stock issues.

    For an edge case, I'll consider a situation where the search returns no results. This tests how the system handles cases where the user's query doesn't match any books. The scenario should show the user getting a message indicating no results found.

    I should ensure each scenario has clear steps, uses appropriate tags, and covers different aspects of the user's interaction with the system. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the language simple and direct as per the instructions.

    Let me structure each scenario properly, making sure they are concise and each serves a specific testing purpose. I'll also ensure that the steps are automatable and that each scenario ends with a clear validation point.
    </think>

    **@SearchHappyPath**
    **Scenario: Successfully search for a book**
    Given the user is on the homepage
    When they search for "The Great Gatsby"
    Then the search results should display "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald

    **@SearchError**
    **Scenario: Search for a book that does not exist**
    Given the user is on the homepage
    When they search for "Nonexistent Book"
    Then the system should display "No results found for your search"

    **@SearchEdgeCase**
    **Scenario: Search for a book with special characters**
    Given the user is on the homepage
    When they search for "Book!"
    Then the search results should handle special characters correctly and display relevant results

    **@SearchPerformance**
    **Scenario: Search for a book with slow network connection**
    Given the user has a slow network connection
    When they search for "1984"
    Then the system should display a loading indicator and eventually show the search results for "1984" by George Orwell

    <think>
    Okay, so the user is asking me to generate some Gherkin scenarios based on their requirements for an online bookstore. They provided a list of seven user stories, and they want me to extract the key requirements and then create scenarios covering happy paths, error cases, and edge cases.

    First, I need to understand what each user story entails. Let's go through them one by one.

    1. **User Registration**: Users can create an account with email and password. So, the core requirement here is about user registration, ensuring that new users can sign up successfully.

    2. **User Login**: Registered users can log in using their credentials. This is about authentication, making sure that users can access their accounts securely.

    3. **Search for Books**: Users can search by title, author, or genre. This implies that the system needs a robust search feature that can handle different criteria.

    4. **Add Book to Cart**: Users should be able to add items to their shopping cart, which means the system must handle adding items and managing the cart effectively.

    5. **Checkout and Payment**: Users can proceed to checkout and make payments. This involves secure payment processing and order confirmation.

    6. **View Order History**: Registered users can view their past orders, so the system needs to maintain and display order history.

    7. **Leave Book Review**: Users can leave ratings and reviews for books they've purchased. This requires a review system tied to purchases.

    Now, the user wants me to extract the key requirements from these stories. I'll list them as concise points without any extra details.

    Next, I need to create Gherkin scenarios covering happy paths, error cases, and edge cases. I should ensure each scenario has clear Given, When, Then steps and use tags appropriately.

    For the happy path, I'll focus on a successful registration, login, search, adding to cart, checkout, viewing order history, and leaving a review.

    Error cases might include things like invalid login credentials, attempting to add an out-of-stock book to the cart, or trying to leave a review without purchasing the book.

    Edge cases could involve searching for a book that doesn't exist or trying to add a book to the cart when there's low stock.

    I should structure each scenario with a clear title, relevant tags, and the necessary steps. Also, I need to make sure the steps are atomic and focused, using parameterization where possible.

    I'll start by drafting each scenario, ensuring they cover all the necessary aspects and that each step is clear and testable. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the output clean as per the user's instructions.
