    Okay, so I need to generate comprehensive Gherkin feature files for the Online Bookstore project, focusing on edge cases, validation errors, and security concerns. The user has provided several user stories, and I need to create scenarios for each, ensuring each has Given, When, Then steps.

    First, I'll go through each user story and identify possible edge cases and validation points. For User Registration, edge cases include using an existing email, weak passwords, and invalid email formats. I'll create scenarios for each of these.

    Next, User Login has security concerns like incorrect credentials, multiple failed attempts leading to lockout, and brute force detection. I'll structure scenarios to cover these cases, ensuring the system handles them appropriately.

    For Search for Books, I'll consider scenarios where the search yields no results, uses special characters, and handles a large number of results efficiently. This will test the system's robustness and performance.

    Adding a Book to Cart might involve scenarios where the book is out of stock or adding multiple copies. I'll ensure the system correctly updates the cart and prevents adding unavailable items.

    Checkout could have issues like insufficient stock after adding to the cart or using an expired credit card. I'll create scenarios to test these situations and ensure proper error handling.

    View Order History should handle unauthorized access and large amounts of data. Scenarios will check if a user can't access another's history and that performance isn't degraded with many orders.

    Leave Book Review needs to prevent unauthorized reviews and handle prohibited language. I'll ensure the system validates these conditions correctly.

    I'll make sure each scenario is tagged appropriately, such as @error_case or @security, and follows the Given-When-Then structure. I'll avoid including the Feature header and focus solely on the scenarios as per the user's instructions.

    Now, I'll structure each scenario with clear steps, ensuring they are automatable and cover the specified concerns without unnecessary details. Each scenario will be concise and focused on a specific edge case or validation point.


    ### Edge Cases and Validation Scenarios

  @error_case @validation

  Scenario: User tries to register with an existing email
    Given the user is on the registration page
    When they enter an email that already exists in the system
    Then they should see an error message stating "Email already exists"
    And the registration form should not submit

  @security @error_case

  Scenario: User enters a weak password during registration
    Given the user is on the registration page
    When they enter a password that does not meet the minimum requirements (e.g., less than 8 characters, no uppercase letter, no special character)
    Then they should see an error message listing the password requirements
    And the registration form should not submit

  @security @error_case

  Scenario: User tries to login with incorrect credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When they enter an invalid email or password combination
    Then they should see an error message stating "Invalid email or password"
    And the system should not allow access to the account

  @security @error_case

  Scenario: Multiple failed login attempts trigger account lockout
    Given the user is on the login page
    When they enter incorrect credentials 5 times in a row
    Then they should see an error message stating "Account locked due to excessive failed attempts"
    And the account should be temporarily locked

  @error_case @validation

  Scenario: User searches for a book that does not exist
    Given the user is on the search page
    When they search for a book title, author, or genre that does not exist in the system
    Then they should see a message stating "No results found for your search"
    And the search results page should be empty

  @error_case @performance

  Scenario: User searches for a book with special characters
    Given the user is on the search page
    When they enter a search query with special characters (e.g., "!@#$")
    Then the system should handle the input gracefully
    And return a message stating "No results found for your search"

  @error_case @validation

  Scenario: User tries to add a book to cart when stock is zero
    Given the user is on the book details page
    When they try to add a book to the cart that has zero stock
    Then they should see an error message stating "This book is currently out of stock"
    And the "Add to Cart" button should be disabled

  @error_case @checkout

  Scenario: User tries to checkout with insufficient stock
    Given the user has added a book to their cart
    When they proceed to checkout and the book's stock becomes zero before payment
    Then they should see an error message stating "The selected book is no longer available"
    And the checkout process should be cancelled

  @security @error_case

  Scenario: Unauthorized access to order history
    Given a user tries to access another user's order history
    When they navigate to the
