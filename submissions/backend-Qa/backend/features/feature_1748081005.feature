Feature: feature_1748081005

    Okay, I need to improve the Gherkin feature file for an online bookstore. The user provided a starting point but wants it to cover more aspects like edge cases, error conditions, security, performance, and integration tests. Let me break down each feature and think about the scenarios needed.

    Starting with User Registration. The existing scenarios cover valid registration, invalid email, weak password, and duplicate email. I should add more edge cases like missing required fields, SQL injection attempts, and server errors. Also, check if the remember me functionality works and if the system handles concurrent registrations without issues.

    Next, User Login. The existing scenarios include successful login, invalid credentials, and remember me functionality. I should add cases for account lockout after multiple failed attempts, password reset functionality, and handling of SQL injection in the username.

    For Search and Add to Cart, I need to cover invalid search terms, zero results, SQL injection in search, adding invalid quantities, duplicate items, and handling concurrent adds to cart.

    Checkout and Payment Processing should include scenarios for invalid payment details, declined payments, coupon usage, server errors, and concurrent checkouts.

    Order History needs cases for empty history, invalid date ranges, and concurrent access.

    Leaving a Review should have scenarios for invalid ratings, empty reviews, SQL injection, and concurrent submissions.

    I also need to ensure each scenario is clear and follows the Given-When-Then structure. Parameterize test data where possible and include proper validation points. Make sure to cover integration with external systems like email services and payment gateways, and include performance tests for concurrent operations.

    Finally, I'll structure each feature with a background if needed and ensure all scenarios are comprehensive, covering happy paths, edge cases, error conditions, and security aspects.



Feature: User Registration
As a new user, I want to register an account with my email and password so that I can make purchases and track my orders.

  Background:
    Given the user is on the registration page

  Scenario: Successful Registration with valid email and password
    When the user enters a valid email "test@example.com" and password "StrongP@ssw0rd"
    And clicks the Register button
    Then the user should be redirected to the login page
    And a registration confirmation email should be sent to "test@example.com"
    And the user data should be saved in the database

  Scenario: Registration with invalid email format
    When the user enters an invalid email "test@example" and password "StrongP@ssw0rd"
    And clicks the Register button
    Then an error message "Please enter a valid email address" should be displayed
    And the user should remain on the registration page

  Scenario: Registration with weak password
    When the user enters a valid email "test@example.com" and password "password"
    And clicks the Register button
    Then an error message "Password must be at least 8 characters long and contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one special character" should be displayed
    And the user should remain on the registration page

  Scenario: Registration with duplicate email
    When the user enters an email "existing@example.com" that already exists in the system and password "StrongP@ssw0rd"
    And clicks the Register button
    Then an error message "An account with this email already exists" should be displayed
    And the user should remain on the registration page

  Scenario: Registration with missing required fields
    When the user leaves the email field empty
    And leaves the password field empty
    And clicks the Register button
    Then an error message "Email and password are required" should be displayed
    And the user should remain on the registration page

  Scenario: SQL Injection attempt during registration
    When the user enters an email "<script>alert('XSS')</script>" and password "StrongP@ssw0rd"
    And clicks the Register button
    Then the system should sanitize the input
    And display an error message "Invalid characters detected"
    And the user should remain on the registration page

  Scenario: Server error during registration
    When the user enters a valid email "test@example.com" and password "StrongP@ssw0rd"
    And the database service is unavailable
    And clicks the Register button
    Then an error message "Registration failed due to server error. Please try again later." should be displayed
    And the user should remain on the registration page

  Scenario: Concurrent registrations
    When multiple users attempt to register with different emails and passwords simultaneously
    Then each registration should be processed correctly
    And confirmation emails should be sent to each user
    And no data corruption should occur

Feature: User Login
As a registered user, I want to log in to my account so that I can access my purchases and order history.

  Background:
    Given the user is on the login page

  Scenario: Successful Login with valid credentials
